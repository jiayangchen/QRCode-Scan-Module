***********************************************************************

this file can be used to develop the function of QRCode Scanning, here are two optional versions:
* Eclipse version is from the internet，can run in Eclipse，never be modified，maybe difficult to debug cause it's too old

* Android Studio has been lightly modified by me and can be easier to run in AS
